## London Housing ML Model
#### Overview
This project aims to do the following:
1. Produce a ML model that is trained on London House data that can do the following:
- Accurately (>80%) predict the value of a given house. Initial project is sale price, future addition would be rental price
- Given certain features provide an estimated value.
2. Produce a backend that can ingest a rightmove endpoint and scrape the required data for the model to make a prediction. Or take in required fields through an input box and compute the predicted value
3. Produce a streamlit frontend that displays the scraped information, estimated value and explainable reasons for that value.
